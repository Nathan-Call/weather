# weather

This is a mini project involving a custom React web app that dynamically updates weather information.

I wanted to build a mini project and challenge myself to build something with React that I would actually want to use myself. I'm actively learning React so this project was a good stepping stone in my journey of learning how to integrate React into a tech stack.

The web app is hosted at: (https://nathancall.tech/weather).

The web app uses ZIP code data from GeoNames (https://www.geonames.org/) and it actively calls weather data from the National Weather Service API (https://www.weather.gov/), the AirNow API (https://www.airnow.gov/), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency API (https://www.epa.gov/).
